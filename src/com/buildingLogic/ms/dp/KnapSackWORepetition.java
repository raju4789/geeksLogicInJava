/**
 * 0-1 Knapsack Problem: Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of
 * capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer
 * arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items
 * respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum
 * value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 * 
 * A simple solution is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight and value of
 * all subsets. Consider the only subsets whose total weight is smaller than W. From all such
 * subsets, pick the maximum value subset.
 * 
 * 1) Optimal Substructure: 
 * To consider all subsets of items, there can be two cases for every item:
 * (1) the item is included in the optimal subset, (2) not included in the optimal set. Therefore,
 * the maximum value that can be obtained from n items is max of following two values. 
 * 1) Maximum
 * value obtained by n-1 items and W weight (excluding nth item). 
 * 2) Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W minus weight of the nth 
 * item (including nth item).
 * 
 * If weight of nth item is greater than W, then the nth item cannot be included and case 1 is the
 * only possibility.
